CPU-Benchmark finds out how many times your computer can Math.sqrt in one minute. 


LottoEvent and LottoMadness - LottoMadness contains the void main and when run it creates a pop up window using JPanel and javaswing.UIManager that allows a user to enter six numbers and see how long it would take for those numbers to be picked in a lottery. Also allows the user to just "quick pick" some random numbers. Obviously, this program is capable of running extremely long and shows you just how astronomically low the chances of winning the lottery are.
